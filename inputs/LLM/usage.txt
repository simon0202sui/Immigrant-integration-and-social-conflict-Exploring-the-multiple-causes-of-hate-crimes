**These are our conversation with ChatGPT. I used it to give me some instruction on data cleaning and create ideal plots.**
User: Here is my code
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/inputs/data/3510006601-eng.csv", skip = 1) # Skip the first row

# Remove footnotes at the end of the data
data <- data[1:(nrow(data) - 5), ]

# Convert year to numeric
data <- data %>% mutate(across(starts_with("X"), as.numeric))

# Reshape the data to long format
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Geography, `Type of motivation`), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Count") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Count)) # Remove missing values

# Plot a line chart
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = `Type of motivation`)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Police-Reported Hate Crime by Type of Motivation (2018-2022)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
and error is # Convert year to numeric

It seems there was an error with the mutate function. Let's try a different approach to convert the year columns to numeric. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Identify columns to convert to numeric
cols_to_convert <- grep("^X", names(data), value = TRUE)

# Convert selected columns to numeric
data[cols_to_convert] <- lapply(data[cols_to_convert], function(x) as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9]", "", x)))

# Plot a line chart
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = `Type of motivation`)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Police-Reported Hate Crime by Type of Motivation (2018-2022)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
This code should correctly convert the columns starting with "X" to numeric before plotting the line chart. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
